# Hangman Game

This is a word-guessing game where you have to guess the hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn. You can guess one letter at a time, and you have 6 lives to guess the word.

## How to Play
1. Run hangman.py in your console or terminal.
2. Enter a letter and press enter.
3. If the letter is in the hidden word, it will be revealed. If not, you'll lose a life and a body part of the hangman will be drawn.
4. Keep guessing letters until you either reveal the whole hidden word or run out of lives.
5. If you reveal the whole hidden word, you win! If you run out of lives, you lose.
